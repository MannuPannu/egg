@top Egg Manual

@sc{Egg} is an attempt to provide a seamless integration of @sc{Git}
within @sc{Emacs}.  @sc{Egg} is currently tested with @sc{Git} 1.7.12
and @sc{Emacs} 23. It may work with other versions of @sc{Emacs} and
@sc{Git} but the @sc{Egg}'s developer does not have time to investigate
and fix bugs that only appear in versions or platforms that he doesn't
use. Patches to fix bugs in other emacsen or volunteers to maintain
compatibility however are welcome.

@unnumbered Rant

@sc{Egg} wasn't designed to replace the @sc{Git} excellent official
porcelain layer, especially when used with the @t{bash_completion}
package. In the @sc{Egg}'s developer's opinion: it's pointless to write
a @t{git-mode} in emacs to let user type @kbd{M-x git-reset} when he/she
can do exactly the same thing in @sc{Bash}. An emacs interface to
@sc{Git} should provide the conveniences that would make it easier to
accomplish the same task than the @sc{Git}'s porcelain. @sc{Egg}, thus,
was designed to perform the same goal as @sc{Git Aliases}. Make it more
convenient to accomplish common git operations.

One example:

The in @sc{Egg's} status buffer, when the user @emph{unstages} a file,
@sc{Egg} will invoke different git operations depend on the
origin/status of the file: it was an existing file, it was new file or
it was a file with merge conflicts which were just resolved in the
index.

Again, @sc{Egg} was design to help you accomplish many git common
operations in very convenient @sc{Emacs} way.

As with @sc{Git Aliases}, @sc{Egg} won't save you from learning
@sc{Git}. Instead it expects its user to be familiar with @sc{Git}. This
manual tries to document all @sc{Egg} functionalities and explain the
design of some of the commands.

@unnumbered Acknowledgements

In the beginning, @sc{Egg} was a fork of @sc{Marius Vollmer}'s excellent
@sc{Magit}. While @sc{Egg} was later completely rewritten, it still
keeps the genius @emph{staging/unstaging} metaphor in the @emph{status
buffer}.

@sc{ByPlayer} gracefully picked up the maintainership when Bogolisk went
hiatus for several... years!!! He's the current maintainer of @sc{Egg}
and his repo is at: @file{https://github.com/byplayer/egg}

@node Overview, File, Acknowledgements, Top
@unnumbered Overview

Using @sc{Egg} is simple:
@itemize
@item
download @file{egg.el} and put in your @sc{Emacs}'s @code{loadpath}.
@item
add @code{(require 'egg)} in your @file{.emacs}
@item
very important: disable @sc{Vc}'s git backend.
Do @kbd{M-x customize-option RET vc-handled-backends}.
Then @key{DEL} the Git option.
@item
open a file in a git repo from within emacs. Et voila!

@unnumbered The Egg Minor Mode

@unnumberedsec The Basics
When the @code{egg} library is loaded, @code{egg-minor-mode} will be
activated when visiting a file in a git repository. Whether or not, the
current file is tracked by git, @kbd{C-x v i}
(@ref{egg-file-stage-current-file}) will stage the file, i.e. add its contents
into the index. If you want to compare the current contents of the file
and its staged contents in the index, type @kbd{C-x v =}
(@ref{egg-file-diff}). That key sequences open a @sc{Egg Diff} buffer to
show the deltas, @xref{Diff}. With a prefix,
i.e. @kbd{C-u C-x v =}, the command will prompt for a revision (instead
of using the index) to compare with the file's current contents. If you
prefer using ediff, then type @kbd{C-x v e}
(@ref{egg-file-ediff}). Again, with the @kbd{C-u} prefix, this command
will also let the user specify the revision instead of using the
index. After comparing the file's contents with the index, you might
decide to throw all current modifications. @kbd{C-x v u}
(@ref{egg-file-cancel-modifications}), will revert the file's contents
back to its contents in the index. Some times, you just want to look a
an older, revision of a file, and there's an egg command for that:
@kbd{C-x v ~} (@ref{egg-file-version-other-window}). This command, by
default, show the contents of the current file from the index. With a
prefix, @kbd{C-u C-x v ~}, the command will prompt for a git revision
then show the file's contents from that revision. If you want, instead,
replace the file's current contents with its contents from a revision,
you can use @kbd{C-x v o} (@ref{egg-file-checkout-other-version}).

@unnumberedsec Other parts of Egg
The rest of the minor-mode's key bindings are primarily for launching
egg special buffers to perform various git related tasks.  @kbd{C-x v
s} (@ref{egg-status}) launches the @sc{Status Buffer}, @sc{Egg}'s most
important buffer, to examine the current state of HEAD,
@xref{Status}. @kbd{C-x v l} (@ref{egg-log}), launches the @sc{Log
Buffer}, to view the commit DAG to also perform DAG-related operations
such as branching, pushing, merging, etc. @xref{Log}. If you are an
advanced git user, and has changes stashed away in the current repo,
@kbd{C-x v S} (@ref{egg-stash}) will show the current stack of stashed
WIPs, @xref{Stash}. Another advanced but oh so useful command is
@ref{egg-search-file-changes}, bound to @kbd{C-x v /}. This command
walks the commit DAG and find those which introduced or removed the
@emph{search term}, @xref{Pickaxe}.

@unnumberedsec Pointing Finger
@kbd{C-x v a} (@ref{egg-file-toggle-blame-mode}), will bring the
current buffer in-or-out of annotation-mode, or more accurately,
@emph{blame mode}. In blame-mode, editing is disabled (the buffer is
in read-only mode). Block of lines are prefix with a header describing
the @emph{last} commit that modified those lines, @xref{Blame}, for
more details.

@unnumberedsec Commiting Changes
Once you're happy with your changes to the work tree and you've already
staged all those modifications, the next step is to commit the changes.
Before actually commiting into git, use @ref{egg-commit-log-edit} (bound to
@kbd{C-x v c}) to compose a commit message. This command has different behaviours
depending on prefix, i.e. the number of @kbd{C-u}s before @kbd{C-x v c}, @xref{Commit}.

@unnumbered Status Buffer, playing with your HEAD
This special buffer is one of @sc{Egg}'s two most important special
buffer (the other is the @sc{Log Buffer}). It's launched by the
@ref{egg-status}. This buffer is designed to work with the index and
HEAD. As its name indicates, it show the current status of the
repository. It's also the place where user goes, to resolve conflicts
during merge or rebase.

Out of the box, the status buffer displays a @emph{lot} of
informations. However, you can customize what and how it displays
informations. For @emph{what}, @xref{egg-status-buffer-sections}, for
@emph{how}, @xref{egg-buffer-hide-sub-blocks-on-start}, and
@xref{egg-buffer-hide-sub-blocks-on-start}.

By default, the status buffer display 4 sections. On the top is the
@sc{Repo} section where it shows the current branch (or current commit
if HEAD was detached), the sha1, the repository and optionally the
@sc{Help} section (the Help section can be initally hidden
@pxref{egg-buffer-hide-help-on-start}, or simply omitted
@pxref{egg-show-key-help-in-buffers}). Following the repo section is the
@sc{Unstaged} section. This section shows a sequence of diffs,
describing difference between the index and the work-tree. Next comes
the @sc{Staged} section, this section also contains a sequence of diffs
but they describe the difference between HEAD and the index. Last is the
@sc{Untracked} section where the untracked files in the repository are
listed.

@unnumberedsec Sections in the Status Buffer
@anchor{status-sections} There are several command to help with
navigation within the @sc{Status Buffer}. @kbd{n}
(@ref{egg-buffer-cmd-navigate-next}) and @kbd{p}
(@ref{egg-buffer-cmd-navigate-prev}) will jump from one section (or
subsection) to the next/previous (sub)section. If the cursor was on a
diff header, then @kbd{n} would move the cursor to the first hunk of
the diff. To move to the next/previous section of the @emph{same}
type, use the @kbd{C-u} prefix. Thus, if your cursor was on a diff
header, @kbd{C-u n} will move it to the next diff header.

Sections and subsections can be hidden. @kbd{h}
(@ref{egg-section-cmd-toggle-hide-show}) will toggle a section's
hide/show state and @kbd{H}
(@ref{egg-section-cmd-toggle-hide-show-children}) will hide/show all
@emph{sub}-sections of a (sub)section. You can hide all sections in
the buffer with @kbd{C-c C-h} (@ref{egg-buffer-hide-all}) or show them
all with @kbd{C-u C-c C-h}.

In sections that display diffs sequence, @key{RET} will relocate the
relative position of the cursor back in the original file. If the
cursor was on the diff header of the file @file{foo.h}, then @key{RET}
(@ref{egg-diff-section-cmd-visit-file-other-window}) will open that
file. If the cursor was on line 5 of a hunk displaying lines 112 to
119 of @file{foo.h}, then @key{RET}
(@ref{egg-hunk-section-cmd-visit-file-other-window}) will open
@file{foo.h} and jump to line 117.  For fans of @sc{Ediff}, @kbd{=}
(@ref{egg-diff-section-cmd-ediff}) will launch ediff comparing the 2
operands in the diff under the cursor.

@unnumberedsec Unstaged Changes
@anchor{unstaged-diff-section}
The Unstaged section shows the difference between the index and the
work-tree.  The diffs shown can be a the regular diff or combined diff
in the case you have unmerged changes. Normally, the @kbd{=} key
(@ref{egg-unstaged-section-cmd-ediff}) will launch @code{ediff2} but
if it was an combined diff, then @code{ediff3} would be used
intead. @xref{egg-unmerged-section-cmd-ediff3}. The order in
@code{ediff3} is: @sc{Theirs}, @sc{Ours} and @sc{WorkTree} for
conflicts during merge. For conflicts during rebase: @sc{Ours},
@sc{Theirs} and @sc{WorkTree}.  The @kbd{s}
(@ref{egg-diff-section-cmd-stage}) key is used to move contents into
the index. If the cursor was on a diff header, then @kbd{s} would
stage the entire file. If the cursor was on a hunk, the @kbd{s}
(@ref{egg-hunk-section-cmd-stage}) would only stage that hunk. To
stage all local modifications, use @kbd{S}
(@ref{egg-stage-all-files}). If instead of staging, you want to throw
away the local modifications, the use the @kbd{u} key. Again, if the
cursor was on a hunk, then only that hunk would be thrown away
(@pxref{egg-hunk-section-cmd-undo}). On the other hand, if the cursor
was on a diff header, then all local modifications to that file would
be thrown away (@pxref{egg-diff-section-cmd-undo}). To throw away all
unstaged and @emph{staged} modifications of a file, put the cursor of
the diff header and type @key{DEL}
(@ref{egg-diff-section-cmd-revert-to-head}). This command will revert
the file back to its contents in HEAD.

@unnumberedsec Staged Changes
@anchor{staged-diff-section}
The Staged section shows the difference between the index and HEAD.
The key bindings in this section are very similar to the Unstaged
section. All the navigation commands are the same. @kbd{=}
(@ref{egg-staged-section-cmd-ediff3}) will launch @code{ediff3} to
compare HEAD, the index and the work tree. @kbd{s} will unstage the
hunk under the cursor (@ref{egg-hunk-section-cmd-unstage}) or the
whole file of the diff header under the cursor
(@ref{egg-diff-section-cmd-unstage}).

@unnumberedsec The Untracked Section
This simple section lists the untracked and @emph{unignored} files in
the repository. The keybindings are very simple. @kbd{s}
(@ref{egg-status-buffer-stage-untracked-file}) will stage the file under
the cursor. @key{RET} (@ref{egg-find-file-at-point}) will open the file
and @key{DEL} (@ref{egg-ignore-pattern-from-string-at-point}) will add
an ignore pattern based on the file-name under the cursor.

@unnumberedsec General Commands
In the Status Buffer or most of Egg's special buffers, @kbd{q}
(@ref{egg-quit-buffer}) will quit and bury the buffer. @kbd{g}
(@ref{egg-buffer-cmd-refresh}) will refresh redisplay. @kbd{c}
(@ref{egg-commit-log-edit}) will launch the Commit Buffer to let you
composing the message before commiting. @kbd{o}
(@ref{egg-status-buffer-checkout-ref}) will prompt for a revision to
checkout. However, it's probably easier and clearer for new user to
peform revision checkout in the Log Buffer @xref{Log}. The same can be
said for @kbd{d} (@ref{egg-diff-ref}), it's easier in the Log Buffer.
The Log Buffer itself can be launched from the Status Buffer with a
single key @kbd{l} (@ref{egg-log}). The @ref{egg-reflog} command is just
a different way of launching the Log Buffer is bound into the key
@kbd{L}.  Finally, @kbd{w} (@ref{egg-status-buffer-stash-wip}) will
stash the current work-in-progress and @kbd{W} (@ref{egg-stash}) will
shows the stack of stashed-away WIPs, @xref{Stash}.

During @sc{Rebase}, @key{RET}
(@ref{egg-buffer-selective-rebase-continue}) will continue the rebase,
@kbd{u} (@ref{egg-buffer-selective-rebase-skip}) will skip the current
(stopped) commit while @kbd{x} (@ref{egg-buffer-rebase-abort}) will
abort the rebase altogether.

@node Commit, Log, Status, Top
@unnumbered Commit Buffer
Once the user is happy with the work tree and staged all the new
modifications in the index, it's committing time. But before committing,
git would need a @emph{commit message}. The command
@ref{egg-commit-log-edit} will launch the Commit Buffer to let the user
composing the commit message.  Once the done composing, @kbd{C-c C-c}
(@ref{egg-log-msg-done}) will actually perform the git commit action
with the newly composed message from the buffer's editing area.

If @code{egg-commit-log-edit} was launched without any prefix, once
composing was done, @kbd{C-c C-c} will just commit the index with the
message. If @code{egg-commit-log-edit} was launch with @kbd{C-u} prefix,
the message of the previous commit will be loaded into the editing area
and @kbd{C-c C-c} will amend the last commit with the index and the
re-composed message. If @code{egg-commit-log-edit} was launch with
@kbd{C-u C-u} prefix, it will simply amend the last commit with the
index, the message of the last commit will be re-used.

Similar to the Status Buffer, the Commit Buffer is composed of 4
sections: the Heading and the Editing Area; the Staged Section; the
Unstaged Section; the Untracked Section. The Heading reminds the
commiter of branch (s)he is commiting into, the repository (s)he working
in and the identifications that will be recorded into the commit. The
contents of the text area will be used as the commit message. The
following 3 sections are there to remind the user @emph{what} will be
commited into the branch what will @emph{not} be. However, the diffs in
the Unstaged (@ref{unstaged-diff-section}) and Staged
(@ref{staged-diff-section}) sections have the local key bindings similar
to what was described in the Status Buffer Chapter, @xref{Status}. Thus,
you can stage and unstage modifications directly in the Commit Buffer,
prior to committing. If you change your mind and want to stop compsing,
then use @kbd{C-c C-k} (@ref{egg-log-msg-cancel}) to cancel everthing.
Because of the buffer is used for entering text, @kbd{g} cannot be use
to refresh the buffer, @ref{egg-buffer-cmd-refresh} is instead bound to
@kbd{C-l}.

The commit messages composed inthe commit buffer are saved in a ring.
@kbd{M-n} (@ref{egg-log-msg-newer-text}) and @kbd{M-p}
(@ref{egg-log-msg-older-text}) will cycle through the ring and bring old
messages into the editing area. @kbd{M-TAB} is conveniently bound to
@code{ispell-complete-buffer} to help with editing text.
